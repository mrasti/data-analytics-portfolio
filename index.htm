      <p>Fascinated by the power of data and its potential to help us to crucially enhance the understanding of our world which can lead to faster and more accurate decision making, I spent my time to achieve skills needed for data analytics during the last year.</p><p>  During this time I worked on three different projects in which I used <i>SQL</i>, <i>Tableau</i> and <i>Excel</i> to spot trends and drive decisions with real-world data. These projects involved Querying Large Databases, Data Cleaning and Manipulation, Statistical Analysis, Visualising Data, Designing Data Dashboards and Final Presentations.</p>
      <p>At the time, I am seeking  a position in data analytics.

This analysis is focused on Earth’s Surface Temperature as an essential parameter for climate monitoring and also carbon dioxide level in the atmosphere which plays a key role in regulating the Earth’s temperature.</p>
