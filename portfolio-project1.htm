      <p>The Earth's climate has changed many times throughout the planet’s history but the current warming trend of climate is of particular significance. The majority of climate scientists agree that climate warming trend over the past century is very likely to be the result of human activity. Beginning late in the 18th century, human activities associated with the Industrial Revolution have changed the composition of the atmosphere and therefore affected the Earth's climate due to greenhouse effect. This analysis is focused on Earth’s Surface Temperature as an essential parameter for climate monitoring and also carbon dioxide level in the atmosphere which plays a key role in regulating the Earth’s temperature.</p>
      <p class="section_title"><b>Data Description</b></p>
      <p>Primarily, three datasets have been used in this study:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><b>Earth Surface Temperature Data:</b> The data has been repackaged from a compilation put together by the Berkeley Earth Surface Temperature group. The Berkeley Earth Surface Temperature Study created a merged dataset by combining 1.6 billion temperature reports from 16 pre-existing archives. In this dataset, the monthly average surface temperature is reported for every country between the years 1750 and 2012.</li>
          <li><b>Carbon Dioxide Levels in Atmosphere:</b> This dataset includes a monthly observation of atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) concentrations from the Mauna Loa Observatory (MLO), Hawaii. CO<sub>2</sub> concentration is reported as a dry mole fraction defined as the number of molecules of carbon dioxide divided by the number of molecules of dry air multiplied by one million&#8202;(ppm). MLO began continuously monitoring and collecting data related to climate change, atmospheric composition and air quality in the 1950's. Due to its remote location in the Pacific Ocean, high altitude&#8202;(3397&#8202;m, 11,135&#8202;ft above sea level) and great distance from major pollution sources, MLO is a prime spot for sampling the Earth's background air in the well mixed free troposphere.</li>
          <li><b>Average Sunspot Number:</b> This dataset is produced by the Solar Influences Data Analysis Center&#8202;(SIDC), World Data Center for the Sunspot Index, at the Royal Observatory of Belgium. This dataset lists the yearly values of sunspot number since 1700. Up to 1944, yearly means were calculated as the average of the 12 monthly means; since 1945 yearly means have been calculated as the average of the daily means.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="section_title"><b>Analysis</b></p>
      <p>As the first step, the changes in Earth's surface temperature was investigated. The surface temperature analysis was done for years between 1870 to 2010. The yearly average global temperature shows an increase over time. The seasonally averaged temperature follows the same trend for all seasons as well.</p>

      <p>Some scientists define climate as the average weather for a particular time period, usually taken over 30-years. The years 1870 to 1900 are taken as the "Reference Years" since they are the first 30 years in this analysis. By plotting the monthly average temperature for reference years, it was observed that temperaure changes happen in a wider range for colder months compared to warmer months. By creating the same visualisations for years 1980 t0 2010&#8202;("Recent Years"), it was observed that the ranges in which changes are happening for colder months are considerably smaller compared to the ranges for reference years. For reference years the difference between maximum monthly temperature&#8202;(July) and minimum monthly temperature&#8202;(January) is  9.81&#8202;&deg;C, while for recent years this value is 8.45&#8202;&deg;C.</p>

      <p>In climate change studies, temperature anomalies are more important than absolute temperatures. The term temperature anomaly is defined as the departure from a reference value or long-term average. In this study, the average temperature for reference years is taken as the reference value. By plotting temperature anomaly by year, it was observed that this term was continuously positive from 1889 and showed an increasing trend over time.</p>

      <p>As early as the 1820s, scientists began to appreciate the importance of greenhouse gases in regulating the temperature of Earth. Further research since that time has demonstrated that the higher concentration of greenhouse gases can lead to an increase in global temperature. Although water vapor is the largest contributor to the Earth’s greenhouse effect, it does not control the Earth’s temperature. The greenhouse effect that has maintained the Earth’s temperature is controlled by non-condensable gases, mainly carbon dioxide&#8202;(CO<sub>2</sub>) with smaller contributions from methane&#8202;(CH<sub>4</sub>), nitrous oxide&#8202;(N<sub>2</sub>O) and ozone&#8202;(O<sub>3</sub>). The world’s foremost continuous record of CO<sub>2</sub> concentration in the atmosphere has been measured by Mauna Loa Observatory&#8202;(MLO), Hawaii, since 1958. By plotting CO<sub>2</sub> concentration vs. time it was observed that CO<sub>2</sub> shows an increasing annual rate of 1.44 ppm. In 2010, the annual average CO<sub>2</sub> concentration stood at 390 ppm, which shows over 23% increase compared to conditions at the start of the record&#8202;(315ppm).</p>

      <p>Scientists have also considered the sun-climate hypothesis to see if there is any connection between climate changes and solar variations. One of the indicators of solar activity is sunspot numbers. By comparing global temperature variations with sunspot numbers, it is observed that solar changes can not explain the increasing temperature trend. The number of spots on the Sun rise and fall in a regular repeating cycle while the average annual temperature follows an increasing trend.</p>

      <p class="section_title"><b>Conclusions</b></p>
        <ul>
          <li>The last 10 years&#8202;(2001-2010) are the warmest within the 141 years investigated in this analysis with the exception of 1998.</li>
          <li>By comparing Recent Years&#8202;(1980 to 2010) with Reference Years&#8202;(1870 to 1900) it was observed that the difference of monthly average temperature for these two time periods shows higher values for colder months compared to warmer months. This difference for the coldest month&#8202;(January) is 2.02&#8202;&deg;C while for the warmest month&#8202;(July) is 0.66&#8202;&deg;C.</li>
          <li>Analysis results show that temperature anomaly&#8202;(with respect to Reference Years) is continuously positive from 1889 and shows an increasing trend over time.</li>
          <li>It was observed that CO<sub>2</sub> shows an increasing annual rate of 1.44 ppm. In 2010, the annual average CO<sub>2</sub> concentration stood at 390 ppm, which shows over 23&#37; increase compared to conditions at the start of the record &#8202;(315ppm).</li>
          <li>By comparing global temperature variations with sunspot numbers, it was concluded that solar changes can not explain the increasing temperature trend. The number of spots on the Sun rise and fall in a regular repeating cycle while the average annual temperature follows an increasing trend.</li>
        </ul>
      <p class="section_title"><b>Further Suggestions</b></p>
      <p>It is important to consider that increasing global temperature is only one of the indicators of climate change. In order to have a comprehensive understanding of climate, further research needs to be done on other key climate indicators including Arctic sea ice extent, Land ice, Sea level, Hurricane activity, Droughts and precipitation patterns.<br><br><br><br><br></p>
